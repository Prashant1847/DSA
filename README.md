# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** repository!  
This repository contains my step-by-step journey of learning and practicing DSA, primarily for improving problem-solving skills and preparing for coding interviews.

## About This Repository

- Structured in a **topic-wise** and **progressive** manner.
- Covers both **fundamental concepts** and **intermediate to advanced problems**.
- Problems are primarily solved on platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, and 
- Written in **Java**, with each topic in a separate folder.

## Folder Structure

Each folder (e.g., `step_1__learn_the_basics`, `step_2__learn_sorting`) corresponds to a core DSA topic and contains relevant problems and solutions.


> Note: Not all questions have explanations or notes yet; new additions will include those progressively.

## Why This Repo?

- As a **resource for revision** and reference.
- To share my DSA journey with peers.

## Upcoming Additions

- PDF Notes for selected problems and core concepts.
- Links to the original problem statements.
- More well-documented solutions.
